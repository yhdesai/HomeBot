## About
HomeBot is a smart home project which can be controlled using a website or an Android App. It has been designed to also be operated by messaging on Slack, Telegram, Twitter, Discord, and phone call.

If you would like to know more about the project, or try the project out yourself online, Ping me and I will make the arrangements.
